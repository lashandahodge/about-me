# About Me
I am the Founder of Blacks in Civic Tech and I have worked in government for ~3 years. Upon joining government I brought skills such as human-centered design to design and deliver better products and services to the American public. During this time in government, I noticed how few Blacks were in government doing this type of work and often felt there werenâ€™t people who looked like me that I could reach out to bounce ideas off or connect with to share similar problems. Similarly, I also noticed how difficult it was to bring customer experience and human-centered design to government even though those two principles are what drives industry. Since 2021, I have made it my mission to bring more awareness to the benefits of civic tech and promote the increase of Black civic technologists.
